        <h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>Returning a function from a function creates magic.</p>

<h3>Down the rabbit hole</h3>

<p>One of the foundations on which most of functional programming is built is <em>partial</em> or <em>curried</em> functions. An example is better than a thousand words, so here goes (this one&rsquo;s from the <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#partial">Underscore Docs</a>)</p>

        <p>Why does software <em>in the industry</em>  suck so much? Having worked at couple of startups and big companies as well, I can quite honestly say that of all the projects/repos that I had worked on, there was but one that didn&rsquo;t suck. The one that didn&rsquo;t suck, was I&rsquo;m sure in no small part due to the fact that it was written by just one person, the CTO of the company, and since it was a license-based SDK, there was a vested interest in keeping things organized. Open source software projects, when compared with industry projects, are way easier to understand and in much better shape&hellip;</p>

      <section class="content">
        <p>Javascript has garbage collection, so there&rsquo;s no way we can leak memory right? Wrong. Memory leaks are pretty easy to create in Javascript much like in any other language that has <em>garbage collection</em>. The problem isn&rsquo;t that bad when running Javascript on the client - unless you are having a blatantly obvious memory leak that kills your browser everytime the page loads. Writing Javascript on the server on the other hand, means you really have to focus on making sure you are not leaking any memory since your server process is going to be pretty long running&hellip;</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at using Ruby for building up a stateless game server in a MMO setting. Ruby to many people, means Rails, which in turn means, a web app. The typical web app request when viewed through the lens of memory (allocation &amp; deallocation) and IO (DB writes &amp; reads) looks as follows:</p>

If you were like me, a Java engineer getting into Ruby couple years back, you probably would have seen your fair share of JVM bashing by a few people who relished beating on all things Java, while peddling their half-assed gems as software masterpieces. This is not to say that Java, especially it&rsquo;s community, loves to over-engineer the crap out of everything they can lay their hands on, but (and this is a pretty big BUT) the JVM <strong>is</strong> a seminal piece of software. Okay, if you are still hanging around after this rant, I thank you for affording me this indulgence&hellip;</p>
