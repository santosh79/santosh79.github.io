  <section class="content">
    <p><strong>Full disclaimer</strong>: Most of the stuff in this article is from Mr BKS Iyengar&rsquo;s book, The Illustrated Light on Yoga. This article is, in a sense me paying homage to the great piece of literary work that composer Yehudi Menuhin did by writing the foreword.</p>

<h4>Why do this?</h4>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it just feels right. In a certain sense we all wake up everyday looking for inspiration and in my case this has been one of the most inspiring pieces of the written word I have come across. I wanted to know what it feels like to write it, which is exactly what I have done. Every delicious word &amp; phrase in all it&rsquo;s glory..</p>

<h3>Foreword &ndash; by Yehudi Menuhin</h3>

<p>The practice of Yoga induces a primary sense of measure and proportion. Reduced to our own body, our first instrument, we learn to play it, drawing from it maximum resonance and harmony. With unflagging patience we refine and animate every cell as we return daily to the attack, unlocking and liberating capabilities otherwise condemned to frustration and death.</p>

<p>Each unfulfilled area of tissue and nerve, of brain or lung, is a challenge to our will and integrity, or otherwise a source of frustration and death. Whoever has had the privilege of receiving Mr Iyengar&rsquo;s attention, or of witnessing the precision, refinement and beauty of his art, is introduced to that vision of perfection and innocence which is man as first created - unarmed, unashamed, son of God, lord of creation - in the Garden of Eden. The tree of knowledge has indeed yielded much fruit of great variety, sweet, poisonous, bitter, wholesome according to our use of it. But is it not more imperative than ever that we cultivate the tree, that we nourish its roots?</p>

<p>The practice of Yoga over the past thirty years has convinced me that most of our fundamental attitudes to life have their physical counterparts in the body. The comparison and criticism must begin with the alignment of our own left and right sides to a degree at which even finer adjustments are feasible; or strength of will may cause us to start by stretching the body from toes to the top of the head in defiance of gravity. Impetus and ambition might begin with the sense of weight and speed that comes with free-swinging limbs, instead of the control of prolonged balance on foot, feet or hands, which gives poise. Tenacity is gained by stretching in various yoga postures for minutes at a time, while calmness comes with quiet, consistent breathing and the expansion of the lungs. Continuity and a sense of the universal come with the knowledge of the inevitable alternation of tension and relaxation in eternal rhythms of which each inhalation and exhalation constitutes one cycle, wave or vibration among the countless myriads which are the universe.</p>

<p>What is the alternative? Thwarted, warped people condemning the order of things, cripples criticizing the upright, autocrats slumped in expectant coronary attitudes, the tragic spectacle of people working out their own imbalance and frustration on others.</p>

<p>Yoga as practised by Mr Iyengar, is the dedicated votive offering of a man who brings himself to the altar, alone and clean in body and mind, focussed in attention and will, offering in simplicity and innocence not a burnt sacrifice, but simply himself raised to his own highest potential.</p>

<p>It is a technique ideally suited to prevent physical and mental illness and to protect the body generally, developing an inevitable sense of self-reliance and assurance. By it&rsquo;s very nature it is inextricaly associated with the laws of nature: respect for life, truth and patience are all indispensable factors in the drawing of a quiet breath, in calmness of mind and firmness of will.</p>

<p>In this lie the moral virtues inherent in Yoga. For these reasons it demands a complete and total effort, involving and forming the whole human being. No mechanical repetitions is involved and no lip-service as in the case of good resolutions or formal prayers. By its very nature it is each time and every moment a living act.</p>

<p>Mr Iyengar&rsquo;s <em>Light on Yoga</em> has, since it was first published in 1966, enabled many to follow his example and become teachers to carry on his work. I was glad at the time to share in its presentation and I welcome this new concise edition equally enthusiatically. It will bring the basic art of Yoga to a much wider audience and will enable it to be practised at the highest level.</p>
