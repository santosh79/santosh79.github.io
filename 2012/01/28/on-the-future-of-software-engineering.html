  <section class="content">
    <p>Silicon Valley and the rest of the tech industry is going through a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=tech+crunch+shortage+of+talent#pq=tech+crunch+shortage+of+talent&amp;hl=en&amp;sugexp=pfwl&amp;cp=31&amp;gs_id=1s&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=shortage+of+talent+silicon+valley&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=shortage+of+talent+silicon+vall&amp;aq=0w&amp;aqi=q-w1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=e589aff7775bf00f&amp;biw=1319&amp;bih=670">very well documented crisis</a> and no, I&rsquo;m not referring to another tech bubble (although it may be happening). What I&rsquo;m instead talking about is a chronic shortage of engineers and designers.</p>

<p>While a lot of well known VC&rsquo;s, angel investors (insert other hot-shot name here) think it&rsquo;s going to just go away the same way the dot-com bubble burst, I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>

<p>This is not 2000 and thinking of today in terms of the 2000 dot-com bubble is wrong. Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;</p>

<h4>No cloud computing</h4>

<p>This is an ENORMOUS deal. There was no virtualization software back then. No Xen, no vmware. As a result no software as a service products. No EC2, no S3, no rackspace. Nothing. Nada. Web-scale companies such as Facebook, Twitter, <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> (on which I am hosting this blog) just wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get off the ground. Or even if they did, it would have been a super rocky path.</p>

<h4>Modern tools and methods</h4>

<p>If you were working back in 2000, you were probably using a bloated piece of crappy software like Java. There still are a lot of places that just don&rsquo;t get what it means to get things done soon using productive tools, but I&rsquo;ll leave that rant aside for now. Working with a bloated crappy tool meant, slower turn around times between when someone from product would like to see something happen and the engineering doing and it being sput out from QA.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve worked or spoken with anyone working with Ruby/Python/Javascript I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d have been amazed at how fast they got things done. This isn&rsquo;t because they are some kind of magical breed of human beings, who are able to operate at vulcan speed. It&rsquo;s because the tools they use are just that good. Look at <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Paul Graham&rsquo;s essay</a> on how his company was able to get stuffed ship before their competitors just by making the choice to use the right tools.</p>

<p>Here are just a couple of the awesome tools, we have now that didn&rsquo;t exist back then:</p>

<pre><code>- Git/Mercurial (distributed version control eff'ing rocks!)
- Github and it's enormous contribution to open source software
- Rails and similar frameworks for Python
- iOS SDK and the App Store
- Agile/Scrum way of working instead of waterfall
</code></pre>

<p>Couple these with the cloud computing power from point #1 and you have a recipe for being able to build, argue over, ship your product out in days. The <em>argue</em> step could slow down the workflow just a tad bit, but that&rsquo;s an unknown :). This stuff takes months in bigger companies/banks and other obsolete corporations!</p>

<h4>The employment bottle-neck</h4>

<p>Since things are so great and the cost to launch a company and raise capital so little and so easy, a lot of engineers are just going it their own and launching their own startups. You are not going to like any boss as much as yourself, am I right? :)</p>

<h4>What now, what comes next</h4>

<p>I think the way this glut resolves itself, is that startups find a (to borrow an overused phrase in the financial world) <strong>new normal</strong>. What this means is startups will start seeing and getting used to having just one person do the role of five from the past. This is further made possible by today&rsquo;s tools and tech. I spend my day doing sysadmin, developer, machine learning stuff amongst others. This would have been done by atleast 3 different people just a couple of years back. The tools and tech will further evolve to make this <strong>new normal</strong> possible and efficient.</p>

<p>Once startups get used to the feeling of just having a super minimal head count the demand for new talent will ease up and the market will <strong>correct itself</strong>.</p>

<h4>Who gains the most</h4>

<p>The gulf between what it means to be a startup employee and a non-startup employee will widen. If you are a startup founder and are looking for one tech person, you would want that one person to have solved a lot of the tech problems you will probably be running into. In other words, you need someone who has worked in a startup before. This demand, for someone with a specific set of up to date skills forces what economists would call a <strong>specialized economy</strong> and the one&rsquo;s benefitting the most from it would be the ones that can meet those specialized demands, i.e. startup engineers and designers.</p>
